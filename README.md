# Analytics Platform Training Resources

This repository contains digital resources used for training purposes on the
Analytical Platform.

Currently this consists of a series of scripts and assets used with the
[Narakeet](https://www.narakeet.com/) platform to generate short, simple
training videos. Please see the README in the `videos` subfolder for details of
how this works, how to create such videos and things to bear in mind.
