# Video Resources

The quickest way to get started is to copy the `template` directory and adjust.

Things to bear in mind:

* Screenshots and MP4 video should be captured at 1280x720 resolution.
* The `elisabeth`, `william` and `carol` voices seem most human.
* You'll need to upload all the resulting assets to
  [Narakeet](https://www.narakeet.com/).
* It'll take several iterations to refine and adjust your video. Experiment!
* Full details of the scripting options can be [found on Narakeets website](https://www.narakeet.com/docs/format/).
* Free to use music can be [found here](https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music).
